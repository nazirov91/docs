## Step 1: Add a New User

Go to Settings → Team & Security → People, then click Add User.

- Email – login email
- Name – full user name
- Profile Name – how this user appears in the CRM
- Password – initial login password
- Team – assign or create a squad
- Role – agent, admin, etc.
- Optionally enable 2FA for security

Click Next Step to continue.

## Step 2: Configure Payout Settings

On the payout configuration screen:

- Fixed Amount – If you pay the user a base salary or monthly fee, enter it here. Otherwise, leave it 0.
- Percentage from Gross – Enter commission percent (e.g. 20%).
- Custom Ranged Percent – If you use tiered payout logic:

> Example:
> up to $2,000 → 20%
> $2,001–$3,000 → 22.5%
> above $3,000 → 25%

You can add custom ranges as needed.

Click Next Step when finished.

## Step 3: Add User Contact Instruments

This step defines what tools the agent will use for calls, SMS, email, and WhatsApp.

- Click Add User Contact
- Select the channel type (Call, SMS, Email, WhatsApp)
- Enter the contact detail (phone number or email)
- Choose the provider (e.g., Twilio or RingCentral)
- Tick Is Default to mark the main communication line
- Click Save

<Info>
  If you’re using the same number for both Call and SMS, add it twice, once with each channel type.
</Info>

<Info>
  If the contact is from RingCentral, you must click Register — this opens a popup to authorize the
  number on the RingCentral side.
</Info>

## Step 4: Set Up Lead Distribution

Once contacts are set, you’ll be taken to the Lead Distribution screen.

You’ll see a week table (Mon–Sun)

Set how many leads per day this agent should receive

> Example: 10 leads Mon–Fri, 5 on weekends

<Info>Advanced Distribution Filters (Optional)</Info>

If you work with multiple lead sources and want to restrict who gets what:

- Click Filter by Lead Provider
- Select the specific Lead Source (e.g. Lead Provider #1)
- For agents you want to exclude, set lead amount to 0
- For agents who should receive these leads, set their quota

This ensures only the right people get leads from specific providers.

## Final Step: Share Login & Register Number

Once everything is set:

- Click Save
- Share login credentials with your agent
- The agent should go to Profile → User Contacts and click Register on their RingCentral number if used — this activates the number inside BeRocker.
