The **Profile Settings** page is where each user manages their personal communication tools, authentication preferences, and login activity. This setup ensures your account is secure and ready for seamless CRM usage — including messaging, calling, and email.

## Sections Covered:

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- User Contacts (Communication Channels)
- Login Sessions

## 1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security to your account.

- Click the green **Enable** button at the top
- A confirmation modal will appear
- Click **OK** to activate 2FA for your account

<Info>Recommended for all admins and agents handling sensitive customer data</Info>

## 2. Manage User Contact Channels

This section allows you to add and manage the contact methods you’ll use for communication inside the CRM — including **Call, SMS, WhatsApp, and Email**.

## Add a Contact Method

- Click the **+ Add User Contact** button
- In the popup form, select:
- Channel (SMS, Call, WhatsApp, or Email)
- Provider (e.g., Twilio, RingCentral, Mailgun)
- Contact Info (phone number or email address)
- Status (Active, Pending, etc.)
- Check **'Is Default'** to set this as your main communication path
- Click **Apply** to save

<Info>
  You can set one default per channel type (e.g., one default Call number, one default Email, etc.)
</Info>

## Important Rules

- If using the **same number** for **Call and SMS**, you must add it **twice**, selecting each channel separately
- You can mix providers (e.g., use RingCentral for calls and Twilio for SMS)
- You may add multiple options and switch defaults at any time

## RingCentral Users: Don’t Forget to Register

If your contact uses **RingCentral**, you'll see a **'Register'** button next to the number.

- Click **Register**
- This will trigger an OAuth popup to authenticate the number with RingCentral
- Registration is required before the number can be used for calling or texting

<Warning>If you skip this step, outbound communication via RingCentral will fail</Warning>

## 3. View Login Sessions

At the bottom of the page, you’ll find your **login activity log**, which shows:

- Country of access
- Device name
- Last activity timestamp
- IP address

Use this section to:

- Track which devices you’ve used
- Monitor for suspicious access
- Revoke access manually via security settings if needed
