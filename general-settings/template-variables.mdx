# How to Edit & Manage Message Templates

Your dashboard allows you to control all the message templates that are automatically sent to customers by SMS or email. These templates cover different stages in the workflow such as quotes, follow-ups, and booking links.

## Where to Find Templates

1. Go to **Dashboard → Settings → Message Templates**
2. You’ll see a list of templates with these details:
   - **Chat type**: SMS or Email
   - **Scheduler type**: When the message is sent (e.g., Quote, Follow Up, Booking Link)
   - **Status**: Active or Inactive

> **Tip:** Set a template to **Inactive** if you don’t want it used in conversations.

## Why Use Multiple Versions

It’s best to create several versions of the same template. The system will randomly pick one each time, so customers don’t receive the exact same wording repeatedly.

Example versions of a follow-up message:

- “Just checking in about your transport — still interested?”
- “Quick follow-up on your quote. Want me to lock it in?”
- “Hi [lead.first_name], did you want to move forward with booking?”

## Best Practices

- Keep messages short and clear
- Include only one call-to-action (e.g., “Click to book” or “Reply YES”)
- For SMS, include opt-out instructions if required (e.g., “Reply STOP to opt out”)
- Use multiple versions for better engagement

## Troubleshooting

- **Variables didn’t show?** Make sure the variable name is exact and the field exists.
- **Message not sending?** Check if the template is active and has the right scheduler type.
- **Same text every time?** Add more versions for rotation.
