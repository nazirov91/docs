## Set Up Your Business Info for Contracts & Branding

Before sending quotes, contracts, or emails to shippers and carriers, you need to configure your Business Settings in BeRocker. This includes your contact info, branding, and legal links — all of which appear in outgoing documents and messages.

## Step 1: Go to Business Settings

![Business Settings](/images/business-settings.png)
_Business Settings_

- From the sidebar, click Settings
- Then select Business

You'll see three tabs:

- Account details – Contact info and timezone
- Business details – Legal & public company info
- Branding – Logos, brand color, and visual identity

## Step 2: Fill in Your Company Info

Under the Account details tab:

- Account name: Your business or brand name
- Business address: Fill in your full legal address
- Time zone: Select your local time zone (used for automation and scheduling)

> This data is used in contracts, quote PDFs, and email headers.

## Step 3: Add Legal & Public Details

Go to the Business details tab to:

_Business details_

- Add links to your Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or Refund Policy
- Specify your legal entity name, if different from your brand name
- Define your business email and support contact

> These links are displayed on invoices, payment pages, and emails.

## Step 4: Upload Branding Assets

Open the Branding tab:

_Branding tab_

- Upload your logo (recommended for email templates and documents)
- Add an icon (used in compact views)
- Choose a brand color (e.g. your main blue or red)
- Set an accent color (for highlights and buttons)

Enable 'Prefer logo over icon' if your logo includes your business name or tagline.

## Why This Matters

Your business settings are automatically used in:

- Contracts and quotes sent to carriers and shippers
- Email templates, notifications, and task reminders
- Stripe and payment gateway interfaces
- Internal branding for your agents

Skipping this step means documents and emails may look unprofessional or contain missing data.

## Pro Tips

- Use a square icon for best visual results
- Brand color affects buttons and links in email templates
- Set the correct time zone to avoid task and follow-up misfires

## Final Checklist

- Business name and address entered
- Time zone selected
- Logo and colors set
- Legal links added (if available)

Once this setup is done, you’re ready to send professional, branded documents through BeRocker.
