## Connecting Integrations to Power BeRocker CRM

<Info>
  Why this matters: Before you can use BeRocker CRM effectively, you need to connect the
  communication, email, and load board tools your business already relies on. This is the foundation
  of your automation — no integrations = no activity.
</Info>

<Info>
  Goal of this step: Select and connect the services you already use (e.g. Twilio, Mailgun,
  CentralDispatch) so your CRM can send emails, place calls, track shipments, and more.
</Info>

## Step 1: Log In to Your BeRocker CRM

- Go to https://app.berocker.com
- Log in with your account credentials
- You’ll land on your main dashboard

## Step 2: Go to the Integrations Page

_Integrations Page_

- Click Settings in the left-hand menu
- Under BeRocker CRM settings, click Integrations

## Step 3: Connect Your Core Tools

Pick the tools your business already uses and click Configure next to each one to connect it.

You’ll see integrations grouped into categories:

## Communications

- Twilio
- OpenPhone
- RingCentral

## Email

- Mailgun
- SendGrid

## Load Boards

- CentralDispatch
- SuperDispatch

## Other

- Payment Gateway
- Notifications

> Important: You only need to connect the platforms you actually use. At least one email and one communication integration is required for full CRM functionality.

## Final Step: Set Your Default Contact Info

<Info>
  Before proceeding, click the yellow banner: “Please add your default contact details to proceed
  efficiently.”
</Info>

Add your business name, email, phone number — these will be used in all your outgoing messages and templates.

## FAQ

> Q: What happens if I skip integrations? A: The CRM won’t be able to send messages, place calls, or sync leads from boards — which defeats its purpose. Integrations are essential.

> Q: Can I change tools later? A: Yes. You can disconnect or switch providers anytime from the same Integrations page.

> Q: How do I know if it worked? A: When successfully connected, you’ll see Status: Active in green below the tool.

## You’re now ready to use BeRocker!

Once your integrations are active, BeRocker can:

- Automatically send quotes, updates, and reminders
- Power phone and SMS outreach
- Sync leads and loads directly into your pipeline
