description: Learn how to configure SMS and email notifications in BeRocker CRM so you never miss important lead activity.
---

## Overview

BeRocker allows each user to configure their own notifications, so you can stay informed about activity that matters to you — without unnecessary noise.

Notifications can be delivered via **SMS** and **email**, and are triggered only by events related to **leads assigned to you**.

This guide explains how notifications work, how to configure them, and common things to watch out for.

## Before You Start

Before configuring notifications, make sure the following requirements are met:

- You have a **working phone number and email address** connected to your BeRocker profile
- SMS and email messaging are functioning correctly on your account
- You understand that notifications are **user-specific**, not shared across your team

If SMS or email delivery is not working on your account, notifications will not be delivered.

## Important Things to Know

### SMS Usage & Charges
SMS messages are sent using **your own phone number**.  
Any SMS notification sent will count toward usage and charges on your VoIP provider account.

### Lead Assignment
You will only receive notifications for **leads assigned to you**.
If you do not have any assigned leads, no notifications will be sent.

### User-Specific Settings
Each BeRocker user can configure:
- Their own phone number
- Their own email address
- Their own notification preferences

These settings do **not** affect other users on your team.

## How to Configure Notifications

### Step 1: Open Notification Settings

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Select **Notifications**

---

### Step 2: Set Delivery Details

You’ll see two input fields:
- **SMS** (phone number)
- **Email**

Enter the phone number and email address where you want to receive notifications, then click **Save**.

:::note
Do not use the same phone number or email that is already connected to your BeRocker profile.  
Using the same contact details may cause messages to appear in the **Unknown Chats** section.

### Step 3: Choose Notification Events

Scroll down to the **Events** section.

This is where you control which actions trigger notifications.

There are four event categories:
- **Leads**
- **Chats**
- **Payments**
- **Orders**

To enable an event, check the box next to it.  
To disable it, simply uncheck the box.

We recommend reviewing all categories and enabling only the events that are relevant to how you work.

## Managing Your Preferences

- You can update notification settings at any time
- Changes apply immediately after saving
- Only events you enable will trigger notifications
- You will never receive notifications for other users’ leads

---

## Common Issues & Tips

- Not receiving messages?  
  Make sure SMS or email is working on your account first.
- Seeing messages in **Unknown Chats**?  
  Double-check that your notification contact details are different from your profile contact details.
- Too many notifications?  
  Review your selected event types and disable unnecessary ones.

## Summary

Once configured, notifications help you stay on top of lead activity without constantly checking the platform.

Each user controls their own setup, delivery method, and event preferences — giving you flexibility without distractions.
