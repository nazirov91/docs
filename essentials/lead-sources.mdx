# Integration with the BeRocker CRM

This documentation explains how to send POST requests to deliver leads to the BeRocker CRM system. Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure that your leads are processed correctly.

## 1. Credentials and Endpoint URL

Head over to the **BeRocker CRM Settings -\> BeRocker AI -\> Lead Sources** There you can click on the **Add new source** button and enter your new lead source details. _For example: Name: Main Website_

Once saved, look at the **URLs** column of the table and click on Copy icon of the newly created lead source.

Keep in mind that when creating a new lead source, the only required field is the name. Everything else is optional. However, I would like to mention what other fields refer to as well. _Plan Name_ - this is for connecting with lead source providers. They usually establish certain plans for sending over leads. That info can be entered in this field _Price_ - also related to lead source providers where there is a price for each incoming lead

## 2. Request Headers

When sending a POST request, make sure to include the following headers:

```json
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 3. JSON Data Format

General Format (For CRM Systems like MessagePlan, BATS)

For most lead providers, use the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "first_name": "string",
  "last_name": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "phone": "5551234567",
  "origin_city": "string",
  "origin_state": "string",
  "origin_postal_code": "12345",
  "destination_city": "string",
  "destination_state": "string",
  "destination_postal_code": "54321",
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "vehicle_model_year": 2020,
      "vehicle_make": "string",
      "vehicle_model": "string",
      "vehicle_inop": true,
      "vehicle_type": "Car"
    }
  ],
  "ship_date": "2025-03-27",
  "transport_type": "open",
  "comment_from_shipper": "string"
}
```

## 4. Example Request for General Format

```json
curl 
-X POST "https://your-endpoint-url"

-d `{
