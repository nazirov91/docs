description: Learn how to connect QuickBooks to BeRocker CRM to securely process payments.
---

BeRocker allows you to connect your QuickBooks account so you can securely process payments directly through your CRM.  
BeRocker does **not** store or handle transactions. Instead, payment details are securely forwarded to QuickBooks—similar to generating an invoice link in QuickBooks and sending it to your customer.

---

## How it works

- Customers add their payment method inside your **Booking Links**.
- When you charge a customer, BeRocker securely routes the payment to QuickBooks.
- QuickBooks processes the transaction and applies any processing fees.
- Funds are deposited directly into your QuickBooks account.

---

## Steps

### 1. Open your BeRocker Dashboard

- Log in to [app.berocker.com](https://app.berocker.com).
- From the left menu, go to **Settings**.

### 3. Set QuickBooks Preferences

- Select **Set as default card payment option**.
- Enter a value in the **Payment Fee** input.
  - Example: If QuickBooks charges a 2% processing fee, enter `2`.
  - The system will automatically add this fee to each transaction to cover your expenses.
- Click **Integrate**.

## Notes

- BeRocker never stores payment details—it simply passes them to QuickBooks securely.
- Processing fees are set by QuickBooks, not BeRocker.
- You can change or disconnect the integration anytime in **Settings > Payment Gateway**.
